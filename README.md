The REngine is the result of a school project at Epitech, called RType. It consists in a small game engine, implementing the ECS design pattern.
For more information, please contact eliot.janvier@epitech.eu.

# V1.0 is here!

## Whats in it

In the 1.0 version, you will find a (mostly) feature complete game engine, with a customizable render pipeline, easy to expand library of components, including colliders, rigid bodies, animations... and the much awaited feature, metadata generation for the user's custom classes to allow for *reflection*. You will also find a server and a client, which you can se to create your own networked games. We also provide a demo project, the RType game but multiplayer.

# How to build
If you wish to build from source, run the following command from the root of the repository:
```bash
python3 fast build
```
